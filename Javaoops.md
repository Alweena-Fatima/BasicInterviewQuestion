1.) Define OOPs?
  Ans: OOPs, or Object-Oriented Programming, is a programming paradigm where code is organized into objects. These objects combine data and the methods that operate on that data, making programs 
  more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.
2.) What are Access Modifiers?
  Ans: Access modifiers are keywords in programming languages like Java and C++ that define the scope and visibility of classes, methods, and variables. They control which parts of a program can access a particular 
  piece of code.
    Public → Accessible from anywhere.
    Protected → Accessible within the same package (Java) or class and derived classes.
    Default (package-private in Java) → Accessible only within the same package.
    Private → Accessible only within the same class.
3.) What is class?
  Ans: these are user-defined data types.It defines the structure and behavior of objects that belong to the same type. Classes consist of fields (variables) and methods (functions).
  public class classname{
    //do something
  }
4. ) What is object?
  Ans: An object is an instance of a class, created using the blueprint provided by the class. Objects have their own state (attributes) and behavior (methods), which are defined in the class.
  class Car {
    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Car is driving");
    }
  }
  Car obj = new Car(); // obj is an object of class Car
  Car --> reference type(class)
  obj --> reference var
  new Car() --> object 

5. ) What is Method ?
  Ans: These are functions that are defined inside a class that describe the behavior of an object. They are useful for re-usability or keeping functionality encapsulated inside one object at a time.
6.) What is Constructor?
  Ans: It is a special method in a class that is automatically called when an object of the class is created.  
  It is mainly used to **initialize the object’s state (variables)**.  
- The name of the constructor is the **same as the class name**.  
- It does **not have a return type** (not even `void`).  
    class Car {
        String color;
        Car(String c) {
            color = c;
        }
        void display() {
            System.out.println("Car color: " + color);
        }
    }
    public class Test {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Car obj = new Car("Red"); // Constructor is called here
            obj.display();            // Output: Car color: Red
        }
    }
